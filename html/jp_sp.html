                    <h2>A green Campus</h2>
                    <p>
                        Singapore Polytechnic campus was developed with sustainability in mind. Firstly, <strong>4 of SP's buildings</strong> have been certified <em>Green Mark Platinum</em>, along with on-going efforts to certify all 22 buildings in SP by 2025. 
                        They also planted 230 species of flora around their campus to allow for a diverse biodiversity. Not only are they making their campus sustainable but they set an example for others schools to follow.

                    <h2>Leading adoption</h2>
                    <p>
                        Singapore Polytechnic launched Singapore's <em>first-ever</em> solar photovoltaics recycling line, which recycles solar panels to their raw materials such as silver and glass to be reused. This will lead to more resources to build other items, 
                        and increase the lifespan of every limited resource we have. Not only that, but this will pave the way for <strong>more photovoltaics recycling plants in the future.</strong>

                    <h2>Collaboration</h2>
                    <p>
                        My school has also collaborated with Sembcorp and CHINT to fast-track sustainable energy development in Asia, two very big organisations. Collaboration is great for many reasons, especially for a task as big as sustainbility. The more we team up to be sustainable,
                        the more carbon dioxide we reduce. It also allows them to make <strong>bigger decisions</strong> for sustainability as they have more power.

                    <h2>Preparing the future generation</h2>
                    <p>
                        All courses in SP will require the students to take common core modules, which teaches a variety of things necessary for their future. One of their focuses is on the UNSDG, 
                        as they believe it will help students be more sustainability minded when going about things. Not only that, but they have a CCA called <a href="https://www.sp.edu.sg/ccas/our-clubs/service-learning/sp-environment-club">SP Environmental Club</a>, which gives students interested in sustainability a platform for enacting change.
