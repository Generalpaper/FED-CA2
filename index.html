                Explanation for what this does, as I use this frequently. What it does is that when you resize the content to large, 
                the div will go from having its own line to entering the main line with col-lg-1. I do this so that the text won't 
                get too wide and the image doesn't become too big.

                                <p>Tech is one of my passions and it's getting more and more interesting. It is one of the few areas which keep on growing. I am a fan of both the programming sector and the tech fabrication sector. For example the laptop I am typing on is one I researched heavily to be the best for me.</p>

                                <h2 class="pt-3">Watching Youtube videos</h2>
                                <p>Youtube, just like tech, has so many new stuff to look at all the time, there is always something to watch. However, I developed a love-hate relationship with this at it takes up too many hours of my day for no reward. This is because it is too addictive and I should regulate my use of it.</p>

                                <h2 class="pt-3">Playing Rubik's Cubes</h2>
                                <p>I used to be very passionate about this, solving the cube hundreds of times per day. I was a speedcuber, trying to solve the cube as fast as possible. While I've had a falling out of this hobby, I am plannning to get back into it with blindfolded solving for memory sports.</p>

                                    I learned programming before polytechnic started, so here's a fun project I made prior to polytechnic which has been adapted to the rules of this CA2.
                                    It's a rainbow canvas, but just like real life, the more you paint the same spot, the darker it gets.
                                    I am interested in programming because it will give me my degree and job.

                                    I would describe myself as a fun and easy-going person, who enjoys jokes. 
                                    I am not the most logic-backed in my 
                                    actions, considering it is <u>12:49am 8/7/2023</u> and I have not even started on the "My Plan" page. As you can see 
                                    I am quite <strong>sporadic</strong> in what and when I do things.

                                    I really like being around people and hanging out. It's extremely nice. It even makes me do things I don't 
                                    normally do, which is either a sign of being prone to peer pressure or maybe just things are more fun 
                                    with friends? Like when I stayed in SP till <em>10pm</em> to do FED because a friend was there too!
